Find out any miss relationship among these entities. If any corrections or suggestions do you have, then provide them. I think you may guess the root entity. I want no data from any entity won't delete, If unfortunately deleting the root entity. I mean to say one entity won't effected by another entity delete. Easily can edit when and where need to edit data. Example, user can edit their data. But user belong to department. department belong to branch. branch belong to company. On user edit fields, user can edit their data but not department, branch or company. If needs any queries, you can point out them but don't give me any queries now. Just give me the relationship among these entities.
